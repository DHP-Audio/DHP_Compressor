# DHP Audio | Compressor VST
  Welcome! The DHP Audio Compressor VST is a basic compression tool for use in Digital Audio Workstations. All DHP Audio products are currently hobby projects of mine that I use as a Learning tool for audio programming.
  
## Installation
  Installation is simple:
  1. Download the "DHPA_Compressor" folder as a .zip
  2. Extract the folder into your "VST Plugins" folder (Or whichever folder you have your VST plugins installed)
  3. Be sure to rescan for VST plugins in your DAW
  4. That should be it!

## Viewing Project Files
  I use the JUCE Framework for developing my plugins, so if you wish to view the project files I recommend installing the JUCE Framework for yourself!

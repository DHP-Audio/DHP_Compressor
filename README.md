# DHP Audio | Compressor VST
  Welcome! The DHP Audio Compressor VST is a basic compression tool for use in Digital Audio Workstations. All DHP Audio products are currently hobby projects of mine that I use as a Learning tool for audio programming, so don't expect beautiful solutions for now!
  
## Installation
  Installation is simple:
  1. Download the "DHP_Compressor_Project" folder as a .zip
  2. Extract the folder into your "VST Plugins" folder (Or whichever folder you have your VST plugins installed)
  3. Be sure to rescan for VST plugins in your DAW
  4. That should be it!

## Known Issues
  There are current issues I have yet to work out, but I hope to address them as soon as I can!
  1. This plugin is currently not being recognized properly by FL Studio. 
  2. The "Analog/Digital" switch I don't believe is functional just yet. Will hopefully fix for the next build version!
